## 🧪 How to Run These Notebooks

You can run these directly in **Databricks Community Edition** or your organization's Databricks workspace.

> 💡 Most notebooks are ready to run as-is. Just make sure to attach to a classic compute cluster (not serverless).

To run locally (optional):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
